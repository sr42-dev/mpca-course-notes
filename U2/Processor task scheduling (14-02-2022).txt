general :

- overlapping (multi-cycle, pipelined) & non overlapping (single cycle, non-pipelined)
- performance = 1/execution time
- if X is n times faster than Y, then n = perf of X/perf of Y

- CPU time = instruction count * clock cycle * cycles per instruction

	- throughput * latency = queue size
	- throughput : number of instructions per unit time
	- latency : time taken per instruction
