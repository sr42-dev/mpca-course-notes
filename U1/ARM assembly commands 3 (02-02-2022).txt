branch instructions :

- branches execute statements under label and return to initial branch statement after
- branching causes address of label to be loaded to r15(pc)

- b <label>; moves to label
- bl <label>; moves to label and copies address of next instruction to r14(lr)

- bne, beq, blt etc are conditional branches taken depending on the result of the preceding comparison statements
- e.g.; program to find sum of n numbers (refer mcpa lab2 programs)

addressing memory locations :

- ldr, str, ldrb, strb, ldrh, strh etc.
- ldr r0, [r1]
- ldr r0, [r1, #1]; r1 + 1 moved to r0
- ldr r0, [r1, r2]; r1 + r2 moved to r0
- ldr r0, [r1, r2, lsl #2]; r1 + 4r2 moved to r0

commenting :

- ; : single line comment
- /**/ : multiline comment

ending a program :

- can be done by software interrupt SWI 0x011
- .end also works
