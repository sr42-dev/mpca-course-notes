general :

- all assembly instructions have to be translated to machine code 
- 26th & 27th bits are 0 for dataprocessing
- 25th bit will be 0 if operand 2 is a register
- 4th bit will be 0 if shifter value is immediate, 1 if register

data processing instructions :

- instructions contain

	- condition : 31 to 28 (1110 for unconditional)
	- 0 0 : 27 to 26
	- # code : 25, operand 2 register status
	- opcode : 24 to 21
	- Rn : 19 to 16
	- Rd : 15 to 12
	
	- operand 2 :

		- other information : 11 to 4
		- Rm : 3 to 0

branch instructions :

- instructions contain

	- condition : 31 to 28 (1110 for unconditional)
	- 1 0 1 : 27 to 25
	- link bit : 24, 0 for branch, 1 for branch with link
	- offset : 23 to 0

multiplication instructions :
