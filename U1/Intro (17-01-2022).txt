introduction :

- 50/50 ISA/ESA split
- ARMSIM 1.9.1
- microprocessor : basic computing unit on IC
- microprocessors are differentiated by instruction set, bandwidth & clock speed
- computer architecture : decisions & tradeoffs in chip design
- programmer & designer perception

microcontroller :

- task specific, compact
- cpu, ram, rom, peripherals included
- small resources, low cost

microprocessor :

- digital input
- no ram, rom, peripherals internally
- not compact system compatible
- high power consumption
- CISC, RISC, special purpose (based on instruction set architecture)

- instruction set 
- bandwidth : number of bits processed per instruction
- clock speed : number of instructions that can be executed per second
