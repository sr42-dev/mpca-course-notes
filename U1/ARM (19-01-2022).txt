general :

- features of ARM :
	- load/store
	- 32 bit instructions
	- 3 instruction formats

- RISC features rejected by ARM
	- register windows : large chip area due to large number of registers
	- delayed branches : when a delay occurs when executing branched commands e.g.; loops (does not scale well to super scalar implementations)
	- single cycle execution : ARM executes most data processing instructions in 1 cycle (possible due to seperate data and instruction memories)
	
- 3 stage pipelining :
	- when 3rd instruction is fetched
	- 2nd instruction is being decoded at that time
	- 1st instruction is being executed at that time
	- all in one cycle : single cycle

- components :
	- register bank :
		- 2 read ports & 1 write port
		- additional read & write port to access r15 (program counter)
		- registers are used to store instructions & break points
	- barrel shifter : used to perform multiplication & division	
	- ALU : adds, subtracts & compares
	- address register : gets addresses of sequential & non-sequential memory blocks
	- data register : stores data retrieved from memory byaddress register
	- instruction register & control logic : 
		- r15 is dedicated to the program counter
		- PC reads address & increments it before returning it to the register

- modes for register bank :
	- User
	- FIQ : fast interrupt (high priority) (only r8 to r14 + spsr accessible)
	- IRQ : interrupt (low priority) (only r13, 14 & spsr accessible)
	- SVC : supervisor (protected) (only r13, 14 & spsr accessible)
	- Undef : undefined (only r13, 14 & spsr accessible)
	- Abort (used to terminate programs e.g.; ctrl+Z, seg. fault (undefined reference to memory)) (only r13, 14 & spsr accessible)

- register bank special registers :
	- CPSR : current program status register (holds 4 status bits)
	- SPSR : saved program status register (holds 4 status bits)
	- r13 (stack pointer) : holds the location of the last item pushed to the stack
	- r14 (link register) : 
		- holds return address when calling a function/subroutine
		- when an abort occurs, r14 holds the return address for the program to go back to

- status register (in order) :
	- 4 bits of flags :
		- Negative (N) : set to 1 if result of previous instruction is -ve
		- Zero (Z) : set to 1 if result of previous instruction is 0
		- Carry (C) :set to 1 if result of previous instruction has a carry out
		- oVerflow (V) : set to 1 if result of previous instruction has an overflow
	- 20 undefined bits
	- 3 interrupt disable bits :
		- I : disables interrupt if set to 1
		- F : disables fast interrupt if set to 1
		- T : ARM state if set to 1 (if thumb mode supported when short of memory)
		- <look up thumb mode in slides>
	- 5 mode bits : defines mode <look up mode bits>
